# Build Instructions

To build the Sudoku game for production, follow these steps:

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    If you haven't already, install the project dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Build for Production:**
    Run the build command. This will create an optimized `dist` folder containing all the necessary files for deployment.
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

After running `npm run build`, the `dist` folder will contain the static assets ready for deployment to a web server or hosting service like GitHub Pages.

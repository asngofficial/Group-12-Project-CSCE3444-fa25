## Hosting on GitHub Pages

The project includes automatic deployment via GitHub Actions! The workflow file is configured at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

### Setup Steps

1. **Push your code to GitHub**

2. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to your repository Settings
   - Navigate to "Pages" section
   - Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"

3. **Automatic deployment**:
   - Every push to `main` branch will automatically build and deploy
   - Check the "Actions" tab to see deployment progress

4. **Update vite.config.ts** (if deploying to a subdirectory):
   ```typescript
   export default defineConfig({
     base: '/your-repo-name/', // Replace with your repository name
     // ... other config
   })
   ```

5. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Deploy to GitHub Pages"
   git push origin main
   ```

Your app will be available at: `https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name/`

### Manual Deployment

If you prefer manual deployment:

1. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy the `dist` folder**:
   - Push the contents of the `dist` folder to the `gh-pages` branch
   - Or use the `gh-pages` package:
   ```bash
   npm install -g gh-pages
   gh-pages -d dist
   ```

## Local Development

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open in browser**:
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

## Data Storage

All user data, puzzles, challenges, and preferences are stored in the browser's `localStorage`. This means:
- ‚úÖ No backend server needed
- ‚úÖ Can be hosted on GitHub Pages for free
- ‚úÖ Works offline after initial load
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Data is device-specific (won't sync across devices)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Clearing browser data will reset the app
